# STLViewer

**STLViewer** is a simple application for loading, parsing, and displaying 3D models from STL files using OpenGL.

This project started as a fun experiment to better understand the STL file format and basic 3D rendering with OpenGL. While working on it, I learned how STL files are structured‚Äîespecially the differences between binary and ASCII formats‚Äîand how to visualize them. Later, I reused the experience gained from this project in one of my university coursework assignments in 2021.

STL (Stereolithography) files come in two formats: [ASCII and Binary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format)). This viewer fully supports Binary STL files and partially supports ASCII STL (due to its limited usage in practice).

Sample STL files can be found in the [STL FILES directory](https://github.com/podzimekdavid/STLViewer-OpenGL/tree/master/STL%20files).
